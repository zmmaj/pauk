# pauk
web browser ( for now only parser).
But I continue to finish.. first ttf rendering. 
How to use ?
SAve it in "uspace/app/"
On the end of app is meson.build who have listing of all apps in this folder..
Add inside "pauk",  -> compile.. 
from tereminal run: pauk page.html  type  enter.
you need to have installed in SrBin OS ( or Helen OS -> dificult but possible):
latest: LEXBOR (for parsing) , mbedtls( https connection) , quickJS, LUA, JSON.  as libraries.
